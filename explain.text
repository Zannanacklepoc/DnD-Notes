I want to create a site that players can write notes for their dnd campaigns.
I will have the user register, log in.
They can then create a campaign, or open up an already existing campaign.
From inside that campaign they have a few different tabs to work with.
A main notes tab where they write notes.
An NPC tab where they can create NPC's that they can delete, update along the campaign.
They have the quest tab that keeps track of their quests.
and of course they have treasure tab where all the parties treasure will be held until it is distributed.
I would love to be able to deploy this site online so people are able to use it once I am done and I can update it and give it other features.
